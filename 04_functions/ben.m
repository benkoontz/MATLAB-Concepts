% matlab functions and constants
% by functions, there's mathematical functions such as sin and cos
cos(0) % prints 1
sin(0) % prints 0
tan(0) % prints 1

A = [1 2; 3 4]
sin(A)

sin(2)
sin(3)
sin(4)

% exponential function 
exp(0)

% log which is oposite of exponential
log(1)
log(exp(1)) % prints 1

sqrt(4) % prints 2

pi % pi is a constant in Matlab

% matlab doesn't have a variable, you have to do
exp(1)

sqrt(-1) % i is a constant

i*i % prints -1

sin(pi) * i*cos(pi)

% create 3x3 identity matrix
I = [1 0 0; 0 1 0; 0 0 1]

eye(3) % does creates identity matrix

zeros(3) % 3x3 matrix of all 0's

zeros(3,2) % creates a 3,2 of all 0's

ones(3,2) % creats a 3,2 of all ones

my_sinh(1)

x = 0:10;
my_sinh(x) % hyperbolic sin for all numbers in x

is_even([1 2 3 4 5])
